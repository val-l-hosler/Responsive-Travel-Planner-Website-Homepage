# Responsive Travel Planner Website Homepage
This is my final project from INFSCI 1420, User-centered design. I translated a [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/tpaEktmKNLp1tK6jbNfWXQ/ExcursionsUnlimitedAppFinal-2021-Copy) into a mobile-first responsive homepage for a travel company's website.

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack 
1. CSS (including Flexbox)
2. HTML

<em>Note: In addition to my CSS (style.css), I am also using normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher. Also, none of the images are my own, and my professor, Mandy Kendall, created the mockup.</em>
